# In one sentence
EDBLite is a library to manage encrypted files, simplifying the difficulties that developers face when securely
storing data in their systems.

# The wish-list
- Multi-format: [KDB, KDBX](https://gist.github.com/lgg/e6ccc6e212d18dd2ecd8a8c116fb1e45),
[Veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Technical%20Details.html).
- Easily embeddable API, with bindings in Python (but others might come).
- Test coverage of 85-90%.
- Peer reviewed: this is for now a one person project, but dealing with crypto is quite a delicate topic. 
Reaching version 1.0 will require at least a review by another developer.
- Full documentation for the API.

# Maybes
- Async API.
- File formats based on cloud storage, like Amazon S3.
